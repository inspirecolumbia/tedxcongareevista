  const whyTedxCopy = `TEDxCongaree Vista reflects not just the location of Columbia, but a spirit of connection, creativity, and growth that aligns with the mission of TEDx. Our theme, “ChangeMakers,” showcases local visionaries already making a difference and transforming Columbia through health education, innovative research, tech startups, or grassroots initiatives. We’re spotlighting community-driven ideas that have shown real impact and carry a clear vision for the future.

The name reflects both the cultural identity and geographic heart of Columbia, South Carolina. Together, they symbolize a spirit of connection, progress, and innovation.

TEDxCongaree Vista will expose attendees to new ways of thinking, unique viewpoints, and an interactive atmosphere filled with rich dialogue and activity. We aim to feature thought leaders from diverse fields and foster meaningful exchanges not only between speakers and the audience, but also among community members themselves.

By sharing ideas in this powerful and collaborative format, we will spark local and personal transformation, inspire change across communities, and celebrate how far we’ve come and where we’re going. By supporting us, you become part of a global movement while helping build something deeply local and lasting. You're not just funding a single event, you’re investing in a platform for innovation, inclusion, and impact.

Help us bring the most meaningful TEDx experience to life in the heart of Columbia. TEDxCongaree Vista is more than an event. It’s a reflection of who we are, and who we have the potential to become.

Let’s create something powerful, together.`;
