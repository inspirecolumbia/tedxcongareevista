              In the spirit of discovering and spreading ideas, TEDx is a program of local,
              self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a
              TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
              connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
              independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the
              TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules
              and regulations.)

                TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design
                converged, but today it spans a multitude of worldwide communities and initiatives
                exploring everything from science and business to education, arts and global issues.
